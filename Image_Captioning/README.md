# Generating caption for an Image

In this part, we will present how to generate a caption for an image. We have already trained a model on Flickr8k dataset.
If you want to train an Image Captioning model from scratch, you can access [the link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) for further information.
