# Generating caption for an Image

In this part, we will present how to generate a caption for an image. We have already [trained a model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_PR2OPob7Qc7eiADU_2_HeLgKn85cBR/view?usp=sharing) on Flickr8k dataset. To run the [Generate_Image_Caption.ipynb](https://github.com/dxtien163/Examples_in_DL/blob/master/Image_Captioning/Generate_Image_Caption.ipynb) file you need to download the weight from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_PR2OPob7Qc7eiADU_2_HeLgKn85cBR/view?usp=sharing).

If you want to train an Image Captioning model from scratch, you can access [the link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) for further information.
